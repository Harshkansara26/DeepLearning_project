## DeepLearning_project

* 1) Supervised Learning: Design and implement your own CNN/RNN model to address the specific task (i.e. image classification/segmentation/anomaly 
detection/sentimentanalysis) of your problem. Groups should experiment and analyze the performance of the architecture using varying hyperparameters 
(i.e. #layers, #neurons, #kernals).Groups should also experiment with different regularization and normalization optimization methods.

* 2) Unsupervised Learning: Design and implement a model for feature extraction or data augmentation task using unsupervised learning approach.
Groups that address the feature extraction should use transfer learning to experiment and analyze the performance of pre-training a model for
the supervised learning task. Groups that address data augmentation should generate new training samples from their generative model and analyze 
the performance of the supervised learning task with the inclusion of the new generate training samples.

* 3) State-of-the-art Models: Many state-of-the-art architectures have emerged, which achieves many state-of-the-art performances for many real-world 
problems. As such, many frameworks offer support for these models. Groups should research and implement one state-of-the-art model for their problem task.
A pre-trained version of many of these state-of-the-art models are available in TensorFlow, groups should experiment and analyze training a new model 
from scratch and transfer learning from the pre-trained model. Groups should analyze and compare the performance of all 3 experiments.
